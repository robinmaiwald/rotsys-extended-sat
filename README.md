The SAT-Framework in this project was designed by Manfred Scheucher.
Link to the original project which is cloned: https://github.com/manfredscheucher/rotsys-sat/tree/main
All Credit regarding the creation of this framework belongs to him.

I used this Framework to study properties of almost complete graphs (complete graphs missing a (perfect) matching) for my bachelor thesis
For this is extended the framework by creating additional parameters.
The diffrence between this project and the  one on Manfreds Scheucher GitHub is that I added additional Parameters to rotsys.py
So what did I do exactly:
I cloned his project and replaced the rotsys.py file with my rotsys-extended.py
I did this so I could link the project in my thesis and in case someone is intrested in the additonal parameters.

Due to time resaons I have not added the Instructions yet.
I will do so and then note it here.
Also I am planing to create a "cleaner" version of rotsys-extended.py within the next week(s)? I will also note this here
Also I plan on marking all sections done by me in the rotsys-extended.py
